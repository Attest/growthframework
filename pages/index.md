# Attest

We use the Engineering Growth Framework as a tool for growth and development, this helps us evaluate where we are and how to progress, build goals and development objectives, and ensure consistency in our approach to this.

This framework will act as a guideline and evolve over time as we get more familiar with it, please feel free to contribute with comments and improvements.

> guideline [noun]: a general rule, principle, or piece of advice

### 🚀 Delivery & Approach

Our growth framework is split into two sections; Delivery and Approach. This balances:

1. **What is necessary for a team to deliver on their specified purpose**
2. **To what extent an individual can impact the team’s delivery**

By thinking about Delivery and Approach and taking into account feedback throughout the last year on our current growth framework, we've been able to redefine and make a lot of expectations clearer, while making big improvements 🙌. 

However, you'll see most of the Delivery and Approach categories are similar to Actions and Abilities, but with some additions and combinations.
