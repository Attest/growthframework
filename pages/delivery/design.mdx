- Able to justify and explain aspects of their design decision, including the use of written proposals.
- Comments on / contributes to system level design with the support of more senior engineers.
- Contributes to discussions about trade-offs in solutions.

##### **Level IV**

- Designs, documents, and implements reliable, testable and elegant solutions to problems.
- Understands and utilises basic design principles (E.g. S.O.L.I.D) and/or design patterns.
- Identifies multiple design options and the associated benefits and risks.
- Able to describe the high-level architecture of the systems within their squad or chapter.

##### **Level V**

- Designs complex systems that scale reliably, with minimal assistance.
- Understands and accounts for current and future capacity requirements.
- Makes changes that support scaling the number of people able to work on the codebase at the same time.
- Inputs into the design of our architectural strategy and vision.

##### **Level VI**

- Drives the technical strategy that influences the direction of the whole chapter.
- Builds systems that scale reliably without intervention, considering trade-offs between things like scalability, efficiency and security.
- Leads system level design that serve as definitive examples for new engineers.

##### **Level VII**

- Anticipates technical risks, communicates them properly to the relevant stakeholders, and makes architectural / design decisions to avoid / resolve them.
- Leads and builds on an architectural strategy and vision, which is transparent, collaborative, and develops buy in with the whole team.
