# Coding & Testing ðŸ’»ðŸ”¬

##### **Level I**

- Learns to write correct code, following guidance and training materials.
- Writes code with support from more senior engineers.
- Responds to PR comments and makes the necessary changes.
- Writes tests with adequate coverage with assistance of others.
- Tries to debug issues with own code understand why things don't work before asking for help.

##### **Level II**

- Able to use follow established design patterns and techniques.
- Writes clean idiomatic code adhering to chapter coding standards.
- Adds appropriate logging and monitoring needed to help with debugging.
- Writes tests with adequate coverage, independently.

##### **Level III**

- Owns the implementation of the solution to their assigned task.
- Code is easy to understand, change, and maintain.
- Proactively improves components, modules, services, systems, and codebases they encounter.
- Adds domain specific metrics to help understand application performance.
- Considers and tests edge-cases.
- Spots opportunities to improve testing.
- Chooses the right data structure for what they are trying to solve.

##### **Level IV**

- Implements changes within components, modules, services, systems, or codebases that require a deep level of domain knowledge.
- Writes code that serves as an example for other engineers.
- Defines appropriate testing metrics and targets.
- Understands and implements the most appropriate forms of test coverage for different scenarios.

##### **Level V**

- Spots inefficient or incorrect uses of the language or bad patterns.
- Makes major contributions to library code and core services.
- Detailed knowledge of the core libraries or APIs for their primary language.
- Implements distributed systems consisting of multiple interacting services.
- Handles complex user flows and error cases.
- Considers the necessity of and acts on wider non-functional testing such as performance testing, application memory tuning, frontend profiling, pen testing.

##### **Level VI**

- Go-to person for any queries about their language or area of the codebase.
- Keeps up to date with the latest language versions and what they offer, applies this where appropriate.
- Mentors the squad and chapter on best practices about their language, latest updates & versions, coding styles.
- Makes major contributions to testing across multiple applications and their connecting technologies, identifies bottlenecks.
- Helps introduce new frameworks, languages, tools, drives adoption of them when suitable.
- Contributes to external technologies or libraries that we depend on, such as opening issues, contributing to active discussions + issues, in the course of solving real business problems.
- Drives the overall chapter's testing architecture to tests complex flows. Uses non-functional testing tools.

##### **Level VII**

- Breaks down the most complicated technical problems and solves them quickly and autonomously.
- Experienced understanding of compiler/virtual machine-level optimisations, and able to explain to others.
- Can jump into others complex coding challenges and is able to quickly understand the context and offer solutions.
- Makes improvements to the stability or performance of the entire platform.
- Has a breadth of knowledge across a range of languages/technologies in different paradigms (e.g. Object-Oriented / Functional) and an ability to rapidly grasp the key concepts in ones which you are unfamiliar with.
- Quickly embraces new languages and helps others understand them.
