# Problem Solving ðŸ¤”

##### **Level I**

- Approaches tasks by first identifying their constituent parts and breaking them down into smaller challenges.
- Can find the balance between working independently and asking for help solving problems when stuck.

##### **Level II**

- Is able to identify, articulate, and break down larger problems.
- Is adaptable and has the ability to change if something is not working, can think of more than one solution to a problem.
- Embraces failure as part of the learning process.

##### **Level III**

- If a solution to a large problem is not immediately forthcoming, can go about independently discovering a solution in a structured way with minimal help.
- Finds solutions independently and shares more widely, recognising that input from others can be useful at every stage.

##### **Level IV**

- Always looks at the root cause of a problem rather than jumping to solutionising.
- Is not tied to decisions/solutions.
- Shares problems and their solutions with others to ensure learnings with peers.

##### **Level V**

- Can solve large-scale or undefined problems that may affect the whole chapter.
- Is able to synthesise information quickly and put forward the best solutions.
- Considers edge cases.
- Matches the right solution to a problem or objective given all constraints.
- Is open minded and flexible in their own thinking and does what is right in a wider context. Has strong opinions weakly held.

##### **Level VI**

- Takes a strategic approach to identifying future problem areas and mitigates before they arise.
- Challenges the status quo and has the attitude that anything can be improved.
- Can tackle problems that affect the whole of R&D and come up with multiple effective solutions.
- Persevering and recognising that solutions to large scale problems can take a period of time to validate, works incrementally to build a solution.

##### **Level VII**

Works on the hardest, largest and most ambiguous problems which affect the whole business and breaks down and solves them effectively - bringing others in when necessary.
